# Organizational Goals

My organization is dedicated to addressing drivers' issues with traffic fines. Our main focuses include:

- Improving performance in terms of response time when an RTF (**Road Traffic Fine**) occurs. All drivers want to receive notifications as soon as possible (or as late as possible to benefit from prescription).
- Establishing clear steps to follow once an RTF is received.

Additionally, being a nonprofit organization, our ideals dictate that we assist all parties involved. Therefore, we have secondary objectives to streamline bureaucratic processes:

- Enhancing understanding of bottlenecks.
- Categorizing RTF bottlenecks as *resolvable*, *not relevant*, and *not resolvable*.
- Identifying patterns within RTFs.
- Providing clear reports highlighting all activities involved in an RTF.
- Furnishing descriptions for each activity enriched with relevant statistics (occurrences, motivations, time intervals between activities, etc.).
- Recommending automations to streamline bureaucratic processes.
- Clarifying errors that may lead to appeals or legal proceedings.
- Ensuring RTFs are genuinely helpful for all drivers.
## Definitions of the Strategic Goals the Organization is Pursuing

### Improved Response Time for RTFs (Road Traffic Fines):

- **Strategic Goal:** Enhance organizational efficiency by reducing the response time for RTFs, showing them the statistics about this.
- **Rationale:** Trying to convince the data owner that timely notifications of RTFs are crucial for driver satisfaction and compliance. Decreasing response time mitigates potential legal complications and fosters trust in the organization's services.
- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** Average time elapsed between RTF occurrence and notification delivery.

### Bureaucratic Process Optimization:

- **Strategic Goal:** Streamline bureaucratic processes to improve overall effectiveness and resource utilization.
- **Rationale:** A streamlined bureaucracy reduces inefficiencies, enhances organizational agility, and ensures equitable treatment for all stakeholders. Optimizing processes increases operational capacity and facilitates better decision-making.
- **KPI:** Percentage reduction in processing time for RTF-related administrative tasks.

## Definition of Operational and Tactical Objectives

### Operational Objective:

- **Objective:** Analyze the current notification process for RTFs and identify areas for improvement.
- **Description:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the organization's current notification process for RTFs. Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks that contribute to delays in communication with drivers.
- **Tactics:** Gather data on the existing notification process, including response times, communication channels used, and feedback from drivers. Utilize analytical tools to identify patterns and areas for optimization. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to understand their perspectives and gather insights.


### Tactical Objective:

- **Objective:** Analyze RTF bottlenecks and propose automation solutions.
- **Description:** Identify bottlenecks in bureaucratic processes related to RTFs and recommend automation strategies to mitigate delays and errors.
- **Tactics:** Conduct thorough process analysis to pinpoint inefficiencies and areas for improvement. Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize automation initiatives based on feasibility and impact.

# Knowledge Uplift Trail

## Analytical Steps:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather event log data from the organization's RTF notification process.
   - Ensure data completeness and accuracy.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleanse and preprocess the event log data to remove inconsistencies and errors.
   - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.

3. **Descriptive Analytics:**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics of the event log data.
   - Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.

4. **Process Mining:**
   - Apply process mining techniques to discover and visualize the underlying processes in the event log.
   - Utilize process discovery algorithms to construct process models based on event sequences.

5. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the RTF notification process using process mining metrics.
   - Measure process efficiency, compliance, and conformance.

6. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify root causes of delays and inefficiencies in the RTF notification process.
   - Investigate factors contributing to bottlenecks and deviations from the expected process flow.

7. **Recommendations:**
   - Propose actionable recommendations for process improvement based on the findings from process mining and root cause analysis.
   - Prioritize recommendations based on their potential impact and feasibility of implementation.

## Assumptions:
- The event log data accurately represents the RTF notification process.
- Sufficient data is available to perform meaningful analysis and derive actionable insights.
- The organization is willing to implement recommended process improvements.
- **TOBEDEFINED:**
  - something about the meaning of the activities
  - something about the classification of RTF and involved parties
  - and so on...

## Research Questions Addressed:
- How efficient is the current RTF notification process in terms of response time?
- What are the main bottlenecks in the RTF notification process?
- Are there any deviations from the expected process flow, and if so, what are the root causes?

#  Project Results

Describe each of the analytical steps in detail, providing the algorithms adopted, the generated diagrams, descriptive statistics, and tests. 

Each step must include a clear reference to the code cells of the submitted Colab project that implement it.  

# Conclusions

Discuss the achievements of the project. Which questions were successfully answered, which are still unclear and why? 

Do the achieved results suggest specific updates to the strategic goals, operational or tactical objectives of the organisation, or data collection procedures? 

If any, highlight those sections in the code where you provided an original contribution proposing a procedure not included in the PM4PY documentation or in the examples proposed in class.
