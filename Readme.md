# Avoiding Traffic Fines -- Business Information System Project 2023/2024:

The project follow the guidelines coming from the Ariel website of the course.

I am using the dataset provided by *de Leoni, M. (Massimiliano); Mannhardt, Felix (2015): Road Traffic Fine Management Process. Version 1. 4TU.ResearchData. dataset. https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:270fd440-1057-4fb9-89a9-b699b47990f5*. 

### Notes:

I am currently using *python >= 3.10.12*, any problems that involves versioning are out of my control.

The `.xes` file is too large to be uploaded, if u wish to replicate my analysis you should download it by yourself.

I am using PMTK as external tool.
